We have a dog friendly workspace, and so people bring their dogs to work. Occasionally the dogs wander out of offices and down the halls. We want to be able to track them. So during a hackathon somebody invented a sonar sensor to attach to the dog’s collar. It emits a signal, listens for the echo, and based on how quick... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Chapter 1 - Fundamental concept of statistics</title><link href="https://aabs7.github.io/posts/Statistics_01/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chapter 1 - Fundamental concept of statistics" /><published>2021-01-25T00:27:00+05:45</published> <updated>2021-01-26T21:39:33+05:45</updated> <id>https://aabs7.github.io/posts/Statistics_01/</id> <content src="https://aabs7.github.io/posts/Statistics_01/" /> <author> <name>Abhish Khanal</name> </author> <category term="Statistics" /> <summary> Random variable: Each time you roll a dice, the outcome will be from 1 to 6. If we roll a dice 10 times, the probability of getting an one is 1/6. Here the combination of values and associated probability is a random variable. Here random doesn’t mean process is non deterministic, only that we lack information to compute the result. We don’t know what will happen except probabilistically.

For general linear measurement model for m measurements and n unknowns: \(y = Hx + v\) In regular least squares, we implicitly assumed that each noise term was of equal variance: \(E[v_i^2] = \sigma ^2 (i = 1,....,m)\) \(R = E[vv^T] = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\\ ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Chapter 1 - Least square method</title><link href="https://aabs7.github.io/posts/least_squares/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chapter 1 - Least square method" /><published>2021-01-07T00:27:00+05:45</published> <updated>2021-01-07T00:27:00+05:45</updated> <id>https://aabs7.github.io/posts/least_squares/</id> <content src="https://aabs7.github.io/posts/least_squares/" /> <author> <name>Abhish Khanal</name> </author> <category term="Robotics" /> <category term="Estimation" /> <summary> Least squares method of estimation The most probable value of the unknown quantities will be that in which the sum of the squares of the differences between the actually observed and the computed values multiplied by numbers that measure the degree of precision is a minimum. -Karl Fredrich Gauss Estimating the resistance by using least square Let’s say we measured resistance of a resistor us... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>SPLAT! installation and LOS analysis</title><link href="https://aabs7.github.io/posts/splat/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SPLAT! installation and LOS analysis" /><published>2021-01-05T14:00:00+05:45</published> <updated>2021-01-05T14:00:00+05:45</updated> <id>https://aabs7.github.io/posts/splat/</id> <content src="https://aabs7.github.io/posts/splat/" /> <author> <name>Abhish Khanal</name> </author> <category term="Radio Telemetry" /> <category term="Simulation and analysis" /> <summary> SPLAT! for RF Coverage SPLAT! open-source software that can be used to analyze a radio link between two locations and to generate coverage maps of RF transmitters. The Coverage maps, path loss and field strength are calculated using Longley-Rice Irregular Terrain as well as the new Irregular Terrain with Obstruction model. SPLAT! can predict RF coverage for any frequencies between 20 MHz and 20... </summary> </entry> </feed>
